- 👋 Hi, I’m @AnushkaJainFirst
- 👀 I’m always eager to help others n currently I am running a community named as "B.Tech Crux" in my college to help my juniors n my current batchmates wih notes, mentorship, updates; etc for FREE! Currently I am studying in 2nd year B.Tech CSE(AI-ML) in SRM University Delhi NCR Ghaziabad
-  I have integrated google groups and email with my github repos of BTech Crux - 1st and 2nd year...Whenever I make any changes in these repos, an email goes to the Email ID's of all the students connected with the repective college year google groups regarding the changes(all the details) that also contains a link that redirects them to the particular change in the repos by clicking it and a link that redirect them to the home page of repos..This helps them to get notified about all the changes and make them remain updated...Also all the notified emals remain available in the "Conversations" section on google groups so that students can get all the emails(regarding the changes) at one place
-  I have deployed lfs(large file system) on github which provides me 1 GB of free folder storage with each file having max storage of 50 MB...I have tracked all the files having file size greater than 50 MB while pushing the files on repos using git bash and compressed them to make their size less than 50 MB...Also I have organised all the notes for the students in such a manner that folder size remains adjusted
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Full Stack Web Development
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects
